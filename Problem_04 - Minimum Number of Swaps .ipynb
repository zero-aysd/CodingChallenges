    "For either option, we have possibly two options for creating a couple on the second couch, and then possibly two options for creating a couple on the third couch, and so on. (We say possibly, because it could be the case that the couch already has a couple sitting on it). So we could recursively go through each of these options, tracking the total number of swaps, and at the end return the minimum"
